By default the program will be running at ./Debug directory, thus you can find all executive files there
		
Directory structure =============================
Directory structure of both server-side and client-side are explained as following.

Server Disk ----------------------------
- ServerRepo	# all check-in files will be placed here
	- ns1.packageA.v1.metadata.xml		# package metadata files are named as "namespace"."package"."version".metadata.xml
	- ns2.packageB.v2.metadata.xml
	- nsX.packageX.vN.metadata.xml
	- ns1	# directory of namespace 1
		- packageA	#directory of package A
			- 1	# version number
				- packageA.h
				- packageA.cpp
	- ns2
		- ...	# same hierachy as above

		
Client-side has the similar directory structure as server-side.
		
Client Disk -----------------------------
- ClientRepo	# all extracted files will be placed here
	- ns1.packageA.v1.metadata.xml
	- ns1
		- packageA
			- 1
				- packageA.h
				- packageB.cpp
